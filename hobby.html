          <p>I am passionate about growing Lady Slipper Orchids or Paphiopedilums.</p>
          <p>The word <em>Paphiopedilum</em> is derived from two Greek words: <i>Paphia</i> (Venus) and <i>pedi(l)on</i> (a sandal).</p>
          <p>The Paphiopedilum is also known as the Lady Slipper Orchid. They are very delicate flowers and require attention. At the same time, the lovely flowers give so much enjoyment, pleasure and delight.</p>

    	<h3 class="uk-accordion-title">Description of the Paphiopedilum</h3>
    	<div class="uk-accordion-content" >
        <p>These enormously popular tropical lady’s slippers are the single most hybridized and awarded orchid genus. The flowers of the 60 species and thousands of hybrids run the gamut of oddly pouched shapes and colors, often with stripes, spots, and “warts,” inspiring great passion in collectors.</p>
        <p>Many types also have beautifully mottled foliage, pretty even out of bloom. Flowers can last for months. </p>
        <p>Paphiopedilum are found from southern India through New Guinea and the Philippines, mostly in montane forests with high seasonal rains and frequently long dry seasons.</p>
        <p><i>Taylor's Guide to Orchids. By Judy White.</i></p>
        <p>Paphiopedilums differ from other orchids in the appearance of the plants as well as their flowers. One of the most obvious features that sets the flowers apart is the lip, which is modified into a pouch, like a cup.</p>
        <p>Another exceptionally showy part of a paphiopedilum flower is the dorsal (uppermost) sepal, which is usually shaped like an upside-down heart and colorfully marked with distinct lines or spots.</p>
        <p>All of the flower parts are thick and waxy, taking on the texture of rubbery plastic in the modern hybrids. Green, brown, white, and pink hues predominate in the species; the hybrids may also contain vivid shades of red and purple. These colors may be subtly blended or patterned in bold stripes and spots.</p>
        <p>Paphiopedilums also have a unique growth habit. Unlike most orchids, which live in the bright sunlight of the treetops, paphiopedilums are terrestrials, living in the shade of the forest floor. Because this environment is always moist, these plants have no waterstoring stems or pseudobulbs.</p>

    	<h3 class="uk-accordion-title">Paphiopedilum Species</h3>
    	<div class="uk-accordion-content">
        <p>The first species Slipper recorded as brought to England and cultivated was Paphio. Venustum, discovered in India by Wallich in the 1800s.</p>
        <p><em><i>Paphio. venustum</i></em> is a beautiful miniature flower, the foliage tessellated or marbled in light and dark green, the undersides of the leaves purple spotted on light green, with the base of the leaf red-purple. The larger species used to create most of the hybrids originated in India and adjacent countries.</p>
        <p>The apex of the inverted pyramid of hybrids is dominated by five species. Four are Indian, the other Asian. The four Indian species are <i>Paphio. insigne</i>, <i>Paphio. villosum</i>, <i>Pahio. spiceranum</i> and <i>Pahio. charlesworthii</i>. The Asian species is <i>Paphio. barbatum</i>.</p>
        <p><em><i>Paphio. insigne</i></em> is considered the beginner’s orchid. It did not get that reputation for nothing; it was earned, because it has always been the most numerous species in cultivation and has withstood years of abuse and remained alive, even if, at times, it was too weak to produce flowers. They mostly appear abject looking and neglected, the leaves trailing limply over the edges if the pots, instead of upright and glossy.</p>
        <p><em><i>Paphio. villosum</i></em> is far more vigorous in habit than <i>Paphio. insigne</i>, with longer and broader leaves and the ability to grow quickly into large plants with vigorous root systems. The type form of <i>Paphio. villosum</i>, with its large, glossy brown, red-brown and gold flowers, is splendid when grown into a specimen plant. It is an excellent plant to use as a seed-raising pot because of its profuse root system.</p>
        <p><em><i>Pahio. spiceranum</i></em> was first brought to England about 1878. It flowered there about a year or so later and attracted great attention. As there were so few plants in the importation, the price quoted for divisions was quite high even for a period when novelties of any sort were expensive. Much smaller occasionally than <i>Paphio. insigne</i> or <i>Paphio. villosum</i>, this new species contributed a share of characteristics to posterity, not least of which was the lovely dorsal sepal and petal median lines of rose-purple, quite obvious in many hybrids far removed from the species.</p>
        <p>The labellum of <i>Pahio. spiceranum</i> is most attractively colored pale to olive green, with reticulations of purple and overtones of other color at times. The staminode, the central part of a Slipper flower, on <i>Pahio. spiceranum</i> is unusually colored.</p>
        <p><em><i>Pahio. charlesworthii</i></em> was one of the last Slippers to be found and brought into cultivation. It was discovered in north-eastern Burma by R.Moore, a government official in the area, growing only on rocky escarpments of limestone, facing to the north or north–west. <i>Pahio. charlesworthii</i> is a most variable species in shape and color.</p>
        <p><em><i>Paphio. barbatum</i></em>, from the Malaysian peninsula, is the only one of the five main species responsible for most hybrids which has tessellated or mottled foliage. This type of foliage is usually taken to indicate a need for slightly warmer cultivation. The difference would be only a matter of two or three degrees, but even this small amount is capable of increasing plant size and health.</p>
        <p>According to collectors and observers, <i>Pahio. barbatum</i> in its habitat is left dry in a fairly long rainless period each year. It grows, however, mostly in shady valleys, the roots getting sustenance from  masses of detritus lodged in crevices of rocky gullies.</p>

    	<h3 class="uk-accordion-title">Care Instructions for Paphiopedilum</h3>
	   	<div class="uk-accordion-content">
         <p><em><i>Light</i></em> Paphiopedilums require shady conditions, as in an east or west window in the home, or near a shaded south window. In the greenhouse, give them some shade and provide about 1,000 to 1,500 foot-candles. In the home, fluorescent lighting is excellent; suspend two or four tube 6 to 12 inches above the leaves.</p>
        <p><em><i>Temperatures</i></em> Paphiopedilums are traditionally separated into two groups: the warm-growing mottled-leafed types and the cool-growing green-leafed types. A third increasingly popular group is the warmer-growing strap-leafed multifloral paphiopedilums.</p>
        <p>Warm-growing types should be kept at 60&deg; F to 65&deg; F during the night, and 75&deg; F to 85&deg;F or more during the day. Cool-growing types should be kept at 55&deg; F to 60&deg; F during the night and 75&deg; F to 80&deg; F during the day. However, many growers raise all plants in the same temperature range with excellent results. The plants can stand night temperatures in the 40&deg; F if necessary, as well as temperatures to 95&deg; F.</p>
        <p><em><i>Water</i></em> Slipper orchids have no pseudobulbs, sa water must be available at the roots constantly. All paphiopedilums need a moist medium – never soggy but never dry. Water paphiopedilums once or twice a week.</p>
        <p><em><i>Humidity</i></em> Paphiopedilums need moderate humidity – between 40-50 percent – which can be maintained in the home by setting the plants on trays of Gravel, partially filled with water. Never let paphiopedilums sit in water. In a greenhouse, average humidity is sufficient. Using an evaporative cooling system is warm climates can increase the humidity. Air movement is essential, especially when humidity is high.</p>
        <p><em><i>Fertilizing</i></em> The plants need to be fertilized on a regular schedule, but be careful not to burn the fleshy, hairy roots. Balanced fertilizers, such as 18-18-18 or 20-20-20, are recommended for paphiopedilums.</p>

          However, a Sheltie isn't the right dog for everyone.

    	<h3 class="uk-accordion-title"> History of Shetland Sheepdog </h3>
	   	<div class="uk-accordion-content">
        <p>Shetland Sheepdogs originated in the Shetland Islands of Scotland. Dogs of a Border Collie type were brought to the islands to help with livestock on the rough, rocky subsistence farms. These dogs were bred to local conditions.</p>
        <p>Over many generations, the animals surviving on the islands became smaller, which made them better to handle the terrain, and hardier to be able to stave off disease.</p>
        <p>A good example of this evolution is the Shetland pony that is much smaller than their cousins. A small, hardy horse required less food and pasture land and was better able to withstand the extremes of weather. This evolution affected all the animals on the islands, including cattle, goats and the dog that would became the Shetland Sheepdog.</p>
        <p>However, the mixture if several different breeds and types of dog made it difficult to standardize the size and look of the early Shelties. The American Shetland Sheepdog Association, said that the ideal Sheltie would be between 13 and 16 inches tall at the shoulder while maintaining the look of a Collie in miniature.</p>
        <p>During the early 1900s, while breeders were attempting to standardize a Sheltie type, crosses with modern Collies were made.</p>
        <p> This helped create the lovely Sheltie head, which looks so much like a smaller version of the Collie, with the correct ears and ear set, as well as the levely Collie and Sheltie expression. This cross also gave the modern Sheltie the Collie’s beautiful, weather-resistant coat.</p>

      <h3 class="uk-accordion-title"> Common Mistakes Dog Owners Make </h3>
      <div class="uk-accordion-content">
        <p><em>“It’s a lot more work than I expected.”</em></p>
        <p>Many first time dog owners will confess that they were unprepared for the burden of responsibility that comes with dog ownership. When you have chosen to adopt a puppy, you have signed an unseen contract obliging you to a lifetime of care for an animal that looks to you for leadership. You will assume the role as the alpha, and for the wellbeing of your new companion.</p>
        
        <p><em>“My dog is untrainable; he will not listen or obey anything that I say.”</em></p>
        <p>Dogs thrive under clear, well-defined rules, issued under confident, unwavering leadership. Guidelines and directions need to be well structured and consistent. By following a regular daily schedule for walking, feeding, training, and play, your dog will surely flourish. Remain firm but reasonable in your administration and enforcement of the rules established. As pack leader, you dog will look to you for cues and direction.</p>
        <p><em>“There is definitely a communication problem between my dog and I.”</em></p>
        <p>This is a common issue frequently reported by first time dog owners. Identifying the signals within the behavioral displays of your dog will help clue you into his needs. By reading your dog’s body language and other subtle cues in his manner, you will be empowered to resolve what appears to be issues of miscommunication.</p>
        <p> First, you need to pay close attention to your puppy, so keep him within view, observing for signals that should cue you to his needs. Eventually, you will begin recognize your dog’s signals of communication.</p>
        <p>Make sure to follow through with your training, and remember not to demand something from your dog that he has not been given a chance to learn yet.</p>
        
        <p><em>“My dog is a wilding and he is riddled with behavioral issues.”</em></p>
        <p>Negative behavioral issues manifest themselves in various ways, such as jumping up on people, aggression, possessiveness, excessive barking, playing rough, biting, and growling or snapping when commands are issued. Each of these behaviors stems from a historic lack of rule enforcement and incomplete training during the puppy’s developmental years.</p>
        <p>The most patience to train and properly care for a puppy? If yes, then it is up to you to provide unconditional love, patience, guidance, and structure immediately upon the arrival of your new addition to the family. These are the basic essentials any new dog owner to assure that the puppy can grow into an obedient, well adjusted, and wanted dog.</p>
        
        <p><em>“I will treat my dog like a human child.”</em></p>
        <p>That is not going to work, and you and your dog are doomed to failure if you begin your relationship with this approach. Yes, your dog is a living, feeling creature that certainly deserves all of the love and respect that we humans can offer them, but remember that your dog is a completely different species, and his care should reflect this fact.</p>
        <p>Dogs have instinctual behaviors, including barking, digging, marking, chewing and more. All of these attributes serve them well in the wild, but as a domesticated pet, these things certainly need shaping and curbing. As everyone is well aware, dogs can be aggressive and will bite if provoked. This often inflicts injury on those in harm’s way. </p>
        <p>Approaching your dog as a human can lead to all sorts of problematic communication issues, and create fertile grounds for negative behaviors to grow from. For you and your dog’s sake, you should make a concerted effort to learn about dog communication and behavior, maintaining a species-specific sensitivity, thereby assuring continuity in communication.</p>
        <p>With this respected, you will be empowered to form a healthier and happier relationship, that you will continue throughout the lifetime of your dog.</p>

        <p><em>“I will train my puppy when I have time.”</em></p>
        <p>That statement reveals an undesirable recipe to have an unruly, out of control puppy who knows no rules or boundaries. Owning and training a puppy requires an ongoing and consistent commitment of your time and energy.</p>
        <p>Immediately after bringing your puppy home, you have to begin investing time into establishment and enforcement of rules, thereby giving your puppy a chance to gain your trust. Daily, weekly, and monthly schedules for puppy activity and training, paired with effectual socialization requires regular time spent with your puppy. None of this is optional.</p>
        <p>If you neglect investing time in your new companion, you will likely end up with an uncontrollable puppy that in order to train in obedience, and train out unwanted, negative behaviors will likely require some serious hands-on-work from a professional.</p>
